Here is the Spanish text to be translated:

<spanish_text>
{text}
</spanish_text>

Your goal is to produce an accurate English translation that preserves the nuances, tone, and stylistic elements of the original Spanish text. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read the Spanish text and analyze the author's writing style. Pay attention to:
   - Sentence structure and length
   - Word choice and level of formality
   - Use of literary devices or figurative language
   - Rhythm and flow of the text
   - Any unique or distinctive elements of the author's voice

2. Begin the translation process:
   - Translate the text sentence by sentence, ensuring accuracy of meaning
   - Choose English words and phrases that best capture the tone and style of the original
   - Maintain similar sentence structures where possible, unless it compromises clarity in English
   - Preserve any idiomatic expressions, metaphors, or cultural references, adapting them if necessary to make sense in English while retaining their essence

3. After completing the translation, review it to ensure it reads naturally in English while still echoing the original Spanish style.

4. Provide your English translation within <translation> tags.

5. After the translation, briefly explain (in 2-3 sentences) how you maintained the author's writing style in your translation. Include this explanation within <style_explanation> tags.

Remember, the goal is not just to convey the meaning, but to do so in a way that an English reader would have a similar experience to a Spanish reader of the original text.
